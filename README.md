This is my project for Popular Movies App (stage I) of Udacity's Associate Android Developer Fast Track.The app meets the following specifications:

#### User Interface - Layout ####
- [x] Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails upon launch fetching data from the        theMovieDB API
- [x] UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
- [x] UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
- [x] Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
#### User Interface - Function ####
- [x] When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.
- [x] When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.
#### Network API Implementation ####
- [x] In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
