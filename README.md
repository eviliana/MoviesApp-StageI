# MoviesApp-StageI

This is my project for Popular Movies App (stage I) of Udacity's Associate Android Developer Fast Track.The app meets the following specifications:

User Interface - Layout 
--- Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails upon launch fetching data from the        theMovieDB API
--- UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
--- UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
--- Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
User Interface - Function
--- When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.
--- When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.
Network API Implementation
--- In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.

Comments by reviewer : "In my perspective, you have done a perfect job implementing popular movie stage 1 and the format of your codes is extremely standard and your codes are easy to be understood. Great job foryour popular movie stage 1! Hope to see your stage 2 codes soon! :)"
