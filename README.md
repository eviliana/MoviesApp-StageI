# MoviesApp-StageI

This is my project for Popular Movies App (stage I) of Udacity's Associate Android Developer Fast Track.
The app meets the following specification:

    Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch fetching data from the theMovieDB API
    Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
        The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
    Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
        original title
        movie poster image thumbnail
        A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
        user rating (called vote_average in the api)
        release date
        
!Important : Please provide your own TMDB API key in res/values/strings.xml
